Basic integration of web2py and AngularJS. Not well tested but it seems to work...

Main features:
- web2py authentication made REST
- single-page app 
- integration with ui-router

To install (Linux):
(1) Download and unzip web2py 
    wget http://www.web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_src.zip
    unzip web2py_src.zip

(2) Clone the repository
    cd web2py/applications
    git clone https://github.com/francescosalvadore/web2py_angularized.git web2py_angularized

(3) Install javascript/css dependencies
    cd web2py/applications/web2py_angularized/static
    bower install

(4) You are ready to start web2py and try
    cd web2py
    python web2py.py -a 'secretpass' -i 127.0.0.1 -p 8001
    You can access the website from http://localhost:8001/web2py_angularized

(5) Now you can register the first user and make it web_admin
    - From the website 
          (http://localhost:8001/web2py_angularized): 
          register the user
    - From the appadmin interface 
          (http://localhost:8001/web2py_angularized/appadmin/index)
          using the 'secretpass'
              * under db.auth_group, create a group named  'web_admin'
              * under db.auth_membership, add the user as a 
                member of the web_admin group
